# ðŸ“Š Advanced Log Analysis

## ðŸ”‘ Core Concepts
| Concept              | Description | Example |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Log Correlation**  | Linking events across sources | Failed logins (4625) + unusual outbound traffic |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Spot deviations from baseline | Login at 3 AM from unusual location |
| **Log Enrichment**   | Add context to raw logs | IP â†’ Country mapping, user role, asset criticality |

## ðŸ›  Techniques
- ðŸ“Œ **Time-based correlation** â†’ Detect lateral movement by analyzing event timelines.  
- ðŸ“Œ **Pattern matching** â†’ Identify brute force attempts, repeated failed logins.  
- ðŸ“Œ **Contextual enrichment** â†’ Match IPs/domains with threat intel feeds.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Strengthen cross-source visibility.  
- Detect complex threats missed by isolated events.  
- Minimize false positives using enrichment.
