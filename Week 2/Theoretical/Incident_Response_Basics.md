# Incident Response Basics — Study Notes

## SANS IR Phases
1. **Preparation** — policies, playbooks, tools, training.
2. **Identification** — detect and analyze incidents.
3. **Containment** — short-term (isolate host), long-term (patch, config).
4. **Eradication** — remove malware, close exploited gaps.
5. **Recovery** — restore services, monitor.
6. **Lessons Learned** — post-mortem, documentation, improvements.

## Key SOC Deliverables
- **Incident Ticket** — lifecycle tracking in TheHive/Jira/ServiceNow.
- **Chain of Custody** — forensic evidence handling.
- **Communication Plan** — internal + external stakeholder updates.

## Golden Rules
- Document everything.
- Contain fast, remediate carefully.
- Minimize business impact.
- Escalate when in doubt.
