# Threat Hunting Methodologies

## Core Concepts
- **Proactive Threat Hunting**  
  - Hypothesis-driven vs. reactive response.  
  - Example: Hunt for anomalous privilege escalation in logs (MITRE ATT&CK T1078 – Valid Accounts).  

- **Hunting Frameworks**  
  - **SqRR** (Search, Query, Retrieve, Respond).  
  - **TaHiTI** (Targeted Hunting integrating Threat Intelligence).  

- **Data Sources**  
  - EDR logs, network traffic, threat intel feeds, system logs.  

## Key Objectives
- Develop structured hunting workflows.  
- Use ATT&CK to guide hypothesis generation.  
- Validate hypotheses with real-world log queries.  

## How to Learn
- Study SANS papers on SqRR & TaHiTI.  
- Review case studies (APT29, APT28).  
- Practice using Elastic Security’s hunting guide.
