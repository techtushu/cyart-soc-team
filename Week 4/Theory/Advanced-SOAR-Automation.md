# Advanced SOAR Automation

## Core Concepts
- **SOAR Components**
  - Orchestration: workflow integrations.
  - Automation: repetitive task automation (e.g., auto-ticketing).
  - Response: automated containment (e.g., IP blocking).  

- **Playbook Development**
  - Automate phishing response, malware triage, IP blocking.  
  - Example: Block C2 IP â†’ create case in TheHive.  

- **SIEM/EDR Integration**
  - Connect SOAR with Wazuh, Elastic, or Splunk.  

## Key Objectives
- Build playbooks to improve SOC efficiency.  
- Automate response to reduce MTTD/MTTR.  

## How to Learn
- Study Splunk SOAR docs.  
- Review playbooks from TheHive Project.  
- Analyze case studies (e.g., phishing automation from CISA).
