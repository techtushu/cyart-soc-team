# Adversary Emulation Techniques

## Core Concepts
- **Adversary Emulation**  
  - Simulate attacker TTPs (e.g., T1566 – Phishing, T1210 – Exploitation of Remote Services).  
  - Validate detection and response capabilities.  

- **Emulation Frameworks**
  - MITRE Caldera for automated simulations.  
  - Red Canary emulation guides.  

- **Red-Blue Collaboration**
  - Red team simulates → Blue team detects/responds.  
  - Improves SOC rules and readiness.  

## Key Objectives
- Develop adversary simulation workflows.  
- Test SOC effectiveness continuously.  

## How to Learn
- Explore MITRE Caldera.  
- Study APT emulation case studies (APT28, APT29).  
- Review Red Canary’s practical guides.
