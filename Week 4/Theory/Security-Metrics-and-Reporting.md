## Core Concepts
- **Advanced SOC Metrics**
  - Dwell Time, False Positive Rate, Incident Resolution Rate.  
  - Example: High MTTD = weak detection pipeline.  

- **Executive Reporting**

  - Use dashboards, charts, and summaries.  

- **Continuous Improvement**
  - Use metrics to identify SOC gaps.  
  - Recommend improvements in tools, processes, or training.  

## Key Objectives
