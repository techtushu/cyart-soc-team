# Post-Incident Analysis and Continuous Improvement

## Core Concepts
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**  
  - Techniques: 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram.  
  - Example: RCA of phishing breach â†’ weak email filters.  

- **Lessons Learned**
  - Structured post-mortems.  
  - Feed findings into improved defenses.  

- **Metrics and KPIs**
  - MTTD (Mean Time to Detect).  
  - MTTR (Mean Time to Respond).  
  - Dwell time, false positive rates.  

## Key Objectives
- Master RCA to prevent recurrence.  
- Improve SOC maturity with measurable KPIs.  

## How to Learn
- Study SANS Reading Room (RCA).  
- Use NIST SP 800-61 guidelines.  
- Explore CISA SOC metrics.
