Security Metrics and Executive Reporting
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a fundamental workflow for a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst. It covers the crucial activities of calculating key security metrics, analyzing findings, and translating technical data into concise, actionable executive-level reports. The tasks are designed to be completed using a combination of popular tools: Elastic Security, Google Sheets, and Google Docs.

1. Metrics Dashboard in Elastic Security
This section outlines how to calculate and visualize three core security metrics within a dashboard, such as one you would create in Elastic Security.

Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
Description: MTTD measures the average time from when a security event occurs to when it is detected by a security tool or analyst.
Formula: MTTD = Σ(Detection Timestamp - Event Timestamp) / Number of Incidents
Calculation:

Step 1: For each incident, find the Event Timestamp (the time the activity happened) and the Detection Timestamp (the time your security tool, like Elastic, generated an alert).

Step 2: Calculate the time difference for each incident.

Step 3: Sum all the time differences and divide by the total number of incidents.

Example:

Incident A: Detected (10:15) - Occurred (10:00) = 15 minutes

Incident B: Detected (11:30) - Occurred (11:00) = 30 minutes

MTTD = (15 + 30) / 2 = 22.5 minutes

Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
Description: MTTR measures the average time it takes to fully resolve an incident after it has been detected. This includes investigation, containment, and recovery.
Formula: MTTR = Σ(Resolution Timestamp - Detection Timestamp) / Number of Incidents
Calculation:

Step 1: Track the time an incident is Detected and the time it is marked as Resolved.

Step 2: Calculate the time difference for each incident.

Step 3: Sum the response times and divide by the total number of incidents.

Example:

Incident A: Resolved (12:15) - Detected (10:15) = 2 hours

Incident B: Resolved (16:30) - Detected (11:30) = 5 hours

MTTR = (2 + 5) / 2 = 3.5 hours

False Positive Rate
Description: This metric indicates the percentage of alerts that are benign and do not represent a real threat. A lower rate indicates more accurate alerting.
Formula: False Positive Rate = (Number of False Positives / Total Number of Alerts) * 100
Calculation:

Step 1: Count the total number of alerts generated by your security system over a specific period.

Step 2: Count the number of those alerts that were investigated and determined to be false positives.

Step 3: Divide the number of false positives by the total number of alerts and multiply by 100.

Example:

Total Alerts: 1000

False Positives: 250

False Positive Rate = (250 / 1000) * 100 = 25%

2. Executive Report in Google Docs
Draft a 150-word executive summary that presents your findings and recommendations for SOC improvement.

Key Elements to Include:
Introduction: Briefly state the purpose of the report (e.g., summarizing recent security performance).

Key Metrics: Present the calculated MTTD, MTTR, and False Positive Rate. Use clear, non-technical language to explain what these numbers mean.

Analysis: Provide a brief analysis of the metrics. For instance, a low MTTD is good, but a high false positive rate is a challenge.

Recommendations: Propose actionable steps for improvement, such as tuning security rules to reduce false positives or providing advanced training to analysts.

Conclusion: Conclude with a forward-looking statement about enhancing the company's security posture.

3. Dwell Time Analysis in Google Sheets
Description: Dwell time is the duration a threat actor is present in a network before being detected. Lowering this is critical to minimize damage.

Calculation and Analysis:
Step 1: Create a simple table in Google Sheets with two columns: Initial Compromise Timestamp and Discovery Timestamp.

Step 2: Fill in the timestamps for a mock incident.

Initial Compromise: September 1, 2025, at 10:00 AM

Discovery: September 15, 2025, at 2:00 PM

Step 3: Use a formula to subtract the two dates. The result is the Dwell Time.

Dwell Time = 14 days and 4 hours.

Summary of Findings (50 words)
Briefly summarize your analysis of the dwell time. This summary should highlight the critical nature of this metric and propose ways to reduce it in the future, such as implementing more robust threat-hunting capabilities.
