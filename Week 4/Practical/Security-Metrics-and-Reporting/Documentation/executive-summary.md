This report summarizes key performance metrics for our SOC, highlighting areas of success and opportunities for improvement. Our Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) is an impressive 0.0027 seconds, demonstrating the exceptional speed and efficiency of our automated systems in identifying threats. The team's Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) is averaging 2.67 hours, which is a solid benchmark for timely incident resolution.

However, our current False Positive Rate stands at 22.22%. This is a critical area for improvement as it can lead to analyst fatigue and divert resources from high-priority threats. We recommend two key actions: first, we should fine-tune our security rules and integrate advanced threat intelligence to reduce low-value alerts. Second, we propose dedicated training for our SOC analysts on advanced threat hunting techniques to further decrease our MTTR and enhance our overall security posture.
